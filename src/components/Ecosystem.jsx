                            French Village Forest Conservation is home to a diverse ecosystem. With historic and interesting flora and fauna, there is something to see for everyone. Whether you are interested in the historic coastal yellow birch that Nova Scotia is famous for, or our small reptile friends that take refuge under rocks; the diversity never stops astonishing.
