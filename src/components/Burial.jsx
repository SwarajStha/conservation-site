              Also known as natural burials, green burials are an environmentally
              conscious alternative to traditional burial practices. During a green
              burial, the deceased is laid to rest in a biodegradable casket,
              shroud, or urn crafted from natural materials like wood or wicker.
              Notably, embalming, which involves the use of toxic chemicals, is
              omitted. These eco-friendly burials take place in specially designated
              natural burial grounds, such as the one described here. Shallow graves
              facilitate swift and natural decomposition, aided by microbial
              activity and the surrounding environment.

              Incorporating natural burials into the Nova Scotian landscape has
              the potential to foster partnerships between land trusts and
              natural burial grounds in the effort to protect the environment.
              These burial sites actively contribute to biodiversity and
              conservation initiatives. Instead of traditional headstones,
              minimalist markers like native plants or GPS coordinates are used.
              All proceeds generated from green burials at this site directly
              support the preservation and restoration of the adjacent natural
              habitat. A green burial is a sustainable and harmonious approach
              to a final resting place, paying homage to both the departed and
              the ecosystem.
